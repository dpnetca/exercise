# Resistor
CLI based quiz to learn to read resistor colour bands

Future Plans:
- option to print questions as:
    - band colour names
    - ansi coloured names
    - ani color only (tan background with colour coded |'s)
-  Add Tolerance and temperature coefficient to resistor package and quiz
- reverse quiz (givern resistance X what are colour bands)
- mixed quiz (combination of given resistance and given bands)

# v1
simple CLI Based quiz with randomly generated resistor bands
currently incomplete (see TODO's in code), V1 will be updated to address todo's
