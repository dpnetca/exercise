# Resistor
CLI based quiz to learn to read resistor colour bands

Future Plans:
- Add Tolerance and temperature coefficient to resistor package and quiz
- reverse quiz (givern resistance X what are colour bands)
- mixed quiz (combination of given resistance and given bands)

# v1
- simple CLI Based quiz with randomly generated resistor bands
- currently incomplete (see TODO's in code), V1 will be updated to address todo's, 
- future plans  above may be added to V1 or saved for V2
