# Exercises

A collection of misc exercises completed for the purpose of expanding personal knowledge of [Go](https://go.dev/). Similar concept to #100daysOfCode projects will range in difficulty, however I am not doing this as a strict 100 days timeline, and the number of proejcts to be completed is undetermined.  Every project will start with a version 1 (v1) release.  As I learn new concepts some projects may be revisted and refactored to take advantage of these new concepts.
