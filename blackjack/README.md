# Blackjack

Closest to 21 without going over wins

## v1
House Rules:
- Deck is infinite in size (cards are not removed from deck as they are drawn, all cards have equal probability at all times)
- Computer is dealer, dealer hits on 16 and below and stays on 17 or above


### future version ideas
- use better card logic from deck of cards api
- allow player to input name
- allow play again, and track results
- handle blackjack (dealt 21)
- allow doubledown and split
